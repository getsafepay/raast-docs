Use this journey as your checklist. It strings together the core concepts, guides, and API calls you need to enable Safepay Raast for your business.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Get aggregator access">
    Request access, receive your [aggregator](/concepts/aggregator), and secure the first `{{secret_key}}`.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create aggregator merchants">
    Link each business you serve to a [Raast merchant](/concepts/raast-merchants) when creating an [aggregator merchant](/concepts/merchant).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Complete KYC/KYB">
    Safepay validates documentation. Expect same-day approval when the Raast merchant is already onboarded; otherwise provide additional paperwork.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enable payment initiation">
    Choose your [payment type](/concepts/payment-types) and follow the respective [use case](/use-cases/overview).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Handle webhooks and reconciliation">
    Subscribe to [webhooks](/concepts/webhooks), poll when necessary, and reconcile using the reporting APIs.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Roll out payouts (optional)">
    Once pay-ins are live, add [instant payouts](/use-cases/payouts) for beneficiaries.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Merchant and Raast merchant linkage

| Scenario | Action |
| --- | --- |
| Raast merchant already exists in Safepay registry | Use `raast_merchant_id` from [Raast merchants](/concepts/raast-merchants) when creating your aggregator merchant. |
| New business entity | Submit documentation so Safepay can create a Raast merchant. Expect longer KYC/KYB timelines. |

<Callout type="info">A single Raast merchant can link to multiple aggregators. This lets merchants work with different platforms simultaneously.</Callout>

### Payment orchestration cheat sheet

- **RTP Now** — Collect once the customer approves immediately. Ideal for cashback or just-in-time payouts.
- **RTP Later** — Give customers more time to approve. Use when invoices can be paid hours or days later.
- **Dynamic QR** — Create per transaction at checkout; you know the amount but not the payer until settlement.
- **Static QR** — Post a reusable QR. Track incoming payments using amount and metadata.

### Operational readiness

- Automate webhook retries and reconciliation dashboards.
- Use [account validation utilities](/concepts/account-validation) to prevent bad debtor or beneficiary data.
- Rotate aggregator keys using the [Access Keys API](/overview/request-access-key) before go-live.
