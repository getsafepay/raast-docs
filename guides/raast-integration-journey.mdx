import { Steps, Callout } from '~/ui/components/Snippet'

Use this journey as your checklist. It strings together the core concepts, guides, and API calls you need to enable Safepay Raast for your business.

## Prerequisites

- `{{aggregator_id}}` issued by Safepay
- `{{secret_key}}` for the target environment
- Base URL set to `https://dev.api.getsafepay.com/raastwire` (sandbox) or `https://api.getsafepay.com/raastwire` (production)

## Integration checklist

<Steps>
  <Step title="Get aggregator access">
    Request access, receive your [aggregator](/concepts/aggregator), and secure the first `{{secret_key}}`.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create aggregator merchants">
    Link each business you serve to a [Raast merchant](/concepts/raast-merchants) when creating an [aggregator merchant](/concepts/merchant).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Complete KYC/KYB">
    Safepay validates documentation. Expect same-day approval when the Raast merchant is already onboarded; otherwise provide additional paperwork.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enable payment initiation">
    Choose your [payment type](/concepts/payment-types) and follow the respective [use case](/use-cases/overview).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Subscribe to webhooks">
    Create webhook endpoints and verify signatures to receive asynchronous status updates.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Roll out payouts (optional)">
    Once pay-ins are live, add [instant payouts](/use-cases/payouts) for beneficiaries.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Merchant and Raast merchant linkage

| Scenario | Action |
| --- | --- |
| Raast merchant already exists in Safepay registry | Use `raast_merchant_id` from [Raast merchants](/concepts/raast-merchants) when creating your aggregator merchant. |
| New business entity | Submit documentation so Safepay can create a Raast merchant. Expect longer KYC/KYB timelines. |

<Callout type="info">A single Raast merchant can link to multiple aggregators. This lets merchants work with different platforms simultaneously.</Callout>

### Key API calls by stage

| Stage | Endpoint | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Access keys | `POST /v1/aggregators/{{aggregator_id}}/keys` | Create additional keys for rotation. |
| Raast merchant lookup | `GET /v1/aggregators/{{aggregator_id}}/raast-merchants` | Find an existing Raast merchant. |
| Merchant onboarding | `POST /v1/aggregators/{{aggregator_id}}/merchants` | Create an aggregator merchant. |
| RTP payments | `POST /v1/aggregators/{{aggregator_id}}/payments` | Initiate RTP Now or RTP Later. |
| QR payments | `POST /v1/aggregators/{{aggregator_id}}/qrs` | Create static or dynamic QR codes. |
| Payouts | `POST /v1/aggregators/{{aggregator_id}}/payout` | Send payouts to beneficiaries. |
| Webhooks | `POST /v1/aggregators/{{aggregator_id}}/webhooks` | Register webhook endpoints. |

### Payment orchestration cheat sheet

- **RTP Now** - Collect once the customer approves immediately. Ideal for cashback or just-in-time payouts.
- **RTP Later** - Give customers more time to approve. Use when invoices can be paid hours or days later.
- **Dynamic QR** - Create per transaction at checkout; you know the amount but not the payer until settlement.
- **Static QR** - Post a reusable QR. Track incoming payments using amount and metadata.

### Operational readiness

- Automate webhook retries and reconciliation dashboards.
- Use [account validation utilities](/concepts/account-validation) to prevent bad debtor or beneficiary data.
- Rotate aggregator keys using the [Access Keys API](/overview/request-access-key) before go-live.
