Payouts are asynchronous like pay-ins. Use this lifecycle to design back-office processes, customer notifications, and retries.

## Prerequisites

- `{{aggregator_id}}` and `{{secret_key}}`
- Validated beneficiary account details (IBAN or alias)
- Webhook endpoint for status updates

## Flow overview

<Steps>
  <Step title="Validate beneficiary">
    Run [`GET /title-fetch`](/concepts/account-validation) or [`GET /account-info`](/concepts/account-validation) before submitting the payout.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Initiate payout">
    Call `POST /v1/aggregators/{{aggregator_id}}/payout` with an idempotent `request_id`, the beneficiary details, and the amount.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Await webhook">
    Safepay pushes status updates to your webhook endpoint. Polling is optional but recommended as a safety net.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Reconcile and notify">
    Update internal ledgers, emit beneficiary notifications, and archive the payload for audit.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Webhook events to expect

Use the [webhooks delivery guide](/guides/webhooks-delivery) for the full event catalog and signature verification. Settlement-related events are emitted as batch processing progresses.

## Status reference

| Status | Description | Recommended action |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `P_INITIATED` | Safepay accepted the payout request and queued it for processing. | Display "processing" in dashboards. |
| `P_RECEIVED` | Beneficiary bank is validating the transfer. | No action; continue waiting. |
| `P_SETTLED` | Funds reached the beneficiary. | Mark payouts complete and notify recipients. |
| `P_FAILED` | The payout could not be delivered (invalid account, compliance block, insufficient balance). | Investigate failure reason, fix data, and retry with same `request_id` if appropriate. |

## Operational best practices

- **Webhook reliability**: Implement exponential backoff retries if your webhook endpoint experiences downtime.
- **Dual controls**: Require two-person review for high-value payouts before calling the API.
- **Ledger reconciliation**: Store the `trace_reference` and `request_id` to match Safepay webhooks with internal ledger entries.
- **Incident response**: Alert operators automatically when a payout remains in `P_RECEIVED` beyond your SLA or enters `P_FAILED`.
