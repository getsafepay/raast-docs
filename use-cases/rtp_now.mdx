title: 'Create Real-Time Payment (Now)'
description: 'Initiate an immediate push payment from a merchant to a customer IBAN using the Raast API'
---

This guide walks you through initiating a real-time payment using the Raast API. The flow assumes the merchant already exists and the aggregator has a valid access key.

Use this pattern when you want to push funds instantly from a merchant to a customer’s account — for example, for cashback, rewards, disbursements, or refunds outside the refund API.

## Flow Summary

1. Authenticate with your access key
2. Create a payment via `/v1/payments`
3. Monitor the status transition: `INITIATED` → `PROCESSING` → `SETTLED` or `FAILED`
4. Optionally handle errors or retry with the same `request_id` (idempotent)

## API Example

```bash title="Create Payment Now" expandable
curl -X POST https://api.getsafepay.com/v1/payments \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <ACCESS_KEY>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "merchant_id": "mch_a1b2c3d4",
    "amount": 5000,
    "debitor_iban": "PK36SCBL0000001123456702",
    "order_id": "CASHBACK-2025-001",
    "request_id": "c278d1ff-98a7-4d24-9f12-4cb26dfb7dd0"
  }'
```

<Warning>Make sure the IBAN is validated and active. Payments to incorrect or closed IBANs will fail.</Warning>

## Parameters

<Fields>
  <Field name="merchant_id" type="string" required="true">ID of the merchant sending the payment</Field>
  <Field name="amount" type="integer" required="true">Amount in paisa (e.g. 5000 = PKR 50.00)</Field>
  <Field name="debitor_iban" type="string" required="true">Customer's IBAN that will receive the funds</Field>
  <Field name="order_id" type="string" required="false">Optional order or reference number for internal tracking</Field>
  <Field name="request_id" type="string" required="true">Unique UUID to enforce idempotency across retries</Field>
</Fields>

## Sample Success Response

```json title="Success Response"
{
  "id": "pm_cdfce1218e144e0ea71ef308e3f11f59",
  "status": "INITIATED",
  "amount": 5000,
  "merchant_id": "mch_a1b2c3d4",
  "debitor_iban": "PK36SCBL0000001123456702",
  "order_id": "CASHBACK-2025-001",
  "created_at": "2025-08-06T14:02:00Z"
}
```

## Monitoring Payment Status

You can monitor the status of the payment by polling:

```bash title="Check Payment Status"
curl -X GET https://api.getsafepay.com/v1/payments/pm_cdfce1218e144e0ea71ef308e3f11f59 \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <ACCESS_KEY>"
```

Or use webhook events to get notified asynchronously (see [Webhook Setup](/concepts/webhooks)).

## Handling Errors

Common errors include:

* Invalid or inactive IBAN
* Insufficient permissions on merchant account
* Reuse of `request_id` with different parameters

Always inspect the response message and retry using the same `request_id` only if the error was network-related.

<Note>A payment can only be initiated by an existing merchant using a valid access key.</Note>
