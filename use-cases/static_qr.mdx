description: 'Generate a reusable QR code linked to a merchant for recurring Raast payments'
---

Static QR codes are linked to a specific merchant’s Raast alias or IBAN and are ideal for recurring, fixed, or location-based payments. Once created, they can be reused indefinitely.

Common use cases include:

- In-store payment displays
- Utility bill payments
- Subscriptions or donations
- Freelancers or service providers with a fixed receiving account

## Characteristics of Static QRs

| Feature         | Static QR                          |
|------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Reusable         | ✅ Yes                              |
| Encodes metadata | ❌ No (no order ID or amount)       |
| Tied to merchant | ✅ Yes                              |
| Ideal for        | POS, invoices, countertop displays  |

<Note>Static QRs do not carry transaction metadata. Any reconciliation must be done using the actual payment object.</Note>

## API Example

```bash title="Create Static QR" expandable
curl -X POST https://api.getsafepay.com/v1/qr \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <ACCESS_KEY>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "type": "STATIC",
    "merchant_id": "mch_84ef70dbad2e4900"
  }'
```

## Request Fields

<Fields>
  <Field name="type" type="string" required="true">Must be set to `"STATIC"`</Field>
  <Field name="merchant_id" type="string" required="true">The ID of the merchant generating the QR</Field>
</Fields>

## Sample Response

```json title="Static QR Response"
{
  "qr_type": "STATIC",
  "qr_data": "000201010211...63043ABF",
  "created_at": "2025-08-06T17:03:00Z"
}
```

* The `qr_data` field contains an EMVCo-compliant QR payload that can be rendered into a scannable image.
* This QR can be printed or displayed for offline or in-store transactions.

<Tip>Static QR payloads are shorter and simpler than dynamic QR, and do not change per transaction.</Tip>

## Rendering the QR

Use a standard QR code library to turn `qr_data` into an image or SVG:

```tsx title="React Example"
import QRCode from 'qrcode.react'

<QRCode value={qrData} size={200} />
```

You can also convert it to a downloadable PNG or display it on web/POS systems.

## Best Practices

* Assign a unique static QR per merchant location if needed
* Educate staff or customers on which QR to scan for which account
* Combine with printed instructions or display templates
* Monitor all payments made to the merchant ID for attribution

<Note>Static QRs do not expire and can be reused across sessions. If you need one-time or metadata-specific payments, use dynamic QR instead.</Note>
