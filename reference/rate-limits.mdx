Safepay Raast does not enforce rate limits at this time.

<Callout type="info">Even without enforced limits, design your integration to handle spikes and transient failures gracefully.</Callout>

## Recommended practices

- Use exponential backoff for `5xx` responses and network timeouts.
- Reuse `request_id` values only when retrying the exact same payload.
- Cache account validation lookups briefly to reduce repeated calls.
