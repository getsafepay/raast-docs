---

Merchants can initiate real-time push payments to a customer’s IBAN or Raast alias using Safepay’s Raast API. These payments are processed instantly and designed for P2P, P2B, and B2B use cases.

This guide covers how to initiate a payment, required fields, and how to manage the payment lifecycle.

## Endpoint

```bash title="Create Payment" expandable
curl -X POST https://api.getsafepay.com/v1/payments \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <ACCESS_KEY>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "merchant_id": "mch_a1b2c3d4",
    "amount": 2500,
    "debitor_iban": "PK36SCBL0000001123456702",
    "order_id": "ORD-12345",
    "request_id": "c1a8d17e-89f0-4f82-b73b-a8338c841234"
  }'
```

<Note>All payment amounts are denominated in the smallest currency unit (e.g. paisa for PKR). 2500 = PKR 25.00</Note>

## Required Fields

<Fields>
  <Field name="merchant_id" type="string" required="true">
    Unique ID of the merchant initiating the payment. Must belong to your aggregator.
  </Field>
  <Field name="amount" type="integer" required="true">
    Amount to be paid, in smallest currency units (e.g. paisa).
  </Field>
  <Field name="debitor_iban" type="string" required="true">
    IBAN of the account to be debited. Must belong to the customer.
  </Field>
  <Field name="order_id" type="string" required="false">
    Optional order reference from your internal system. Useful for reconciliation.
  </Field>
  <Field name="request_id" type="string" required="true">
    A unique UUID to ensure idempotency and traceability of the request.
  </Field>
</Fields>

## Idempotency

Safepay enforces idempotency on all payment creation requests using the request_id field. Repeated requests with the same request_id will not duplicate the transaction but return the original response.

<Note>Always generate a unique request_id per payment. Use a UUID v4 format for best results.</Note>

Successful Response

```json expandable
{
  "id": "pm_4fdba92f2a214b6f93e257e85fef8f7b",
  "merchant_id": "mch_a1b2c3d4",
  "amount": 2500,
  "status": "INITIATED",
  "debitor_iban": "PK36SCBL0000001123456702",
  "created_at": "2025-08-06T10:15:00Z",
  "order_id": "ORD-12345"
}
```

<Note>After creation, the payment moves through the status lifecycle: INITIATED → PROCESSING → SETTLED or FAILED.</Note>

## Status Lifecycle

Every payment transitions through the following statuses:

| Status     | Description                                                |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| INITIATED  | The payment has been accepted and is queued for processing |
| PROCESSING | The Raast switch is validating and executing the payment   |
| SETTLED    | The payment has been successfully executed                 |
| FAILED     | The payment failed due to validation or network error      |

Use the `GET /v1/payments/{id}` endpoint to check the current status of a payment.

## Next Steps

Once the payment is created, you can:

- Monitor its progress via polling or webhook events
- Link it to a dynamic or static QR if initiated via a QR use case
- Refund the transaction using the `/v1/refunds` endpoint if necessary
