Merchants represent the business entities under your aggregator that are authorized to initiate payments using the Raast network. Each merchant is assigned a unique identifier, and all payments must be initiated by a registered merchant.

## Creating a Merchant

Use the following endpoint to create a new merchant:

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.getsafepay.com/v1/merchants \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <ACCESS_KEY>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Acme Retail",
    "identifier": "acme-retail-01"
  }'
```

## Request Body Fields

### Best Practices

- Choose a consistent and descriptive naming scheme for identifiers (e.g. brand-location)
- Use the same identifier across environments (e.g. staging, prod) with different prefixes if needed
- Store the merchant_id returned in the response securely — it is used in all future payment and QR creation calls

## Response

The API will respond with a JSON object containing the merchant’s unique ID, timestamps, and any validation errors if applicable.

```json
{
  "id": "mch_a1b2c3d4",
  "name": "Acme Retail",
  "identifier": "acme-retail-01",
  "created_at": "2025-08-06T10:15:00Z"
}
```

Only registered merchants can create payments or generate QR codes using the Raast API.
