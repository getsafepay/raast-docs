Raast is asynchronous: customers approve or reject requests inside their banking apps, and Safepay pushes the resulting status to your backend via webhooks. Subscribe to these notifications to drive real-time UI updates and back-office automations.

<Callout type="warning">Webhook delivery details (endpoint format, signature headers, retry policy) are pending product documentation. Email [support@getsafepay.com](mailto:support@getsafepay.com) for the latest contract.</Callout>

### Event flow

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a payment or payout">
    Trigger RTP, QR, or payout requests using the APIs in this guide.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Safepay notifies your webhook endpoint">
    When the Raast network confirms the customer decision, Safepay sends an event containing the updated status and relevant metadata.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Acknowledge promptly">
    Respond with `200 OK` to stop retries. Store the payload for audit trails.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Update downstream systems">
    Mark orders paid, release goods, or retry failed payouts based on the status received.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Recommended practices

- Host webhook receivers on a dedicated path (for example, `/webhooks/safepay`) and require HTTPS.
- Validate the payload signature once Safepay publishes the signing algorithm. Until then, pin allowed source IPs.
- Treat webhook payloads as the source of truth for final payment states—even if polling endpoints for redundancy.
- Log every attempt with timestamp, event type, and idempotency key for reconciliation.
