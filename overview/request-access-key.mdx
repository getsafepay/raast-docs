Once your Aggregator account is approved by Safepay, you will be issued an access key. This key is a sensitive credential used to authenticate all API calls made to the Raast system.

## Access Key Format

Access keys are long alphanumeric strings similar to:

```mdx
spk_live_4f3c98b1c84f42b8a82108cfdb2e45f6
```

This key must be included in the `Authorization` header of every API request:

```bash
curl -X GET https://api.getsafepay.com/v1/payments \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer spk_live_4f3c98b1c84f42b8a82108cfdb2e45f6"
```

## Key Management Best Practices

Safepay follows industry-standard security practices and recommends you do the same:

- **Keep your access key secret**: Store it in a secure location like AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault, or a secure environment variable store.
- **Avoid hardcoding**: Never hardcode the key in your codebase or frontend assets.
- **Use different keys for dev/test/prod**: Request separate keys for each environment.
- **Rotate keys periodically**: You may request key rotation by emailing support@getsafepay.com

## Lost or Compromised Key

If your access key is lost, exposed, or compromised:

- Immediately contact support@getsafepay.com
- Your old key will be revoked
- A new one will be issued with minimal disruption

All API requests will fail with a `401 Unauthorized` error if your key is invalid or expired.
