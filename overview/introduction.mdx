Safepay Raast lets aggregators move money across Pakistan’s instant payment network on behalf of their merchants. This documentation is organized to get you production-ready quickly while keeping implementation details explicit.

### Why Safepay Raast

- **Manage many merchants** — Create and supervise multiple [aggregator merchants](/concepts/merchant) under a single [aggregator](/concepts/aggregator) account.
- **Instant pay-ins** — Collect funds using [RTP Now, RTP Later, Dynamic QR, or Static QR](/concepts/payment-types) flows.
- **Instant payouts** — Disburse funds to vendors or beneficiaries with the same credentials.
- **Validation utilities** — Confirm payer and beneficiary details before executing transactions.

### Integration path

1. [Request aggregator access](/overview/create-aggregator) and receive your `{{aggregator_id}}`.
2. [Secure your aggregator secret key](/overview/request-access-key) (`X-SFPY-AGGREGATOR-SECRET-KEY`).
3. [Create aggregator merchants](/concepts/merchant) and link them to [Raast merchants](/concepts/raast-merchants).
4. Follow the [Raast integration journey](/guides/raast-integration-journey) to issue payments, QRs, and payouts.
5. Subscribe to [webhooks](/concepts/webhooks) for asynchronous status updates.

### Environments

Use the Sandbox base URL (`https://dev.api.getsafepay.com/raastwire`) while integrating. Production lives at `https://api.getsafepay.com/raastwire`. Both environments require the same path structure: `/v1/aggregators/{{aggregator_id}}/...`.
