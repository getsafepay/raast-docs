Raast is Pakistan's instant payment network operated by the State Bank of Pakistan. Safepay Raast gives you an aggregator-grade API to onboard merchants, initiate payments, and move funds between bank accounts and mobile wallets.

## Payment types you can support

1. **RTP Now** - Request a payment the customer approves immediately.
2. **RTP Later** - Request a payment that the customer can approve later.
3. **Dynamic QR** - Generate a per-transaction QR with a known amount.
4. **Static QR** - Use a reusable QR where the customer enters the amount.

## How Safepay fits

- **Aggregator model** - You create [aggregator merchants](/concepts/merchant) and link them to [Raast merchants](/concepts/raast-merchants).
- **Payments and payouts** - Initiate RTP and QR payments, and send payouts with the same credentials.
- **Operational tooling** - Manage access keys, refunds, webhooks, and ledgers through APIs.
