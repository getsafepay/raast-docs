Getting started with Safepay Raast involves four main steps:

<Steps>

<Step title="Request Aggregator Access">
To use Safepay’s Raast APIs, you must first operate under an Aggregator account. This step cannot be completed via API.

Email support@getsafepay.com with:
	•	Company Name
	•	Contact Person
	•	Business Use Case
	•	Expected payment volume

Safepay will manually provision your Aggregator account and return your first access key securely.

</Step>

<Step title="Receive and Secure Access Key">
Once your aggregator account is approved, you’ll receive an `access_key`. This key is required for all API requests and must be passed in the `Authorization` header.

<Warning>Do not expose this key in frontend applications or client-side code. It should remain on your backend only.</Warning>
</Step>

<Step title="Create a Merchant">
Use your access key to create one or more merchants under your aggregator. Each merchant will be issued a unique identifier and will be responsible for initiating payments via Raast.
</Step>

You can create merchants using the /v1/merchants endpoint. See Merchant Concept Guide for field definitions and examples.

<Step title="Initiate Payments">
Once a merchant is created, they can begin initiating real-time payments to a customer’s IBAN or alias. Payments can also be requested using QR codes.

You may choose between static QR codes (linked to fixed details) or dynamic QR codes (customizable per transaction). Refer to the Use Cases section for live examples.
</Step>

</Steps>

<Note>All API calls must be authenticated using your Aggregator access key. You must onboard at least one merchant before initiating a payment.</Note>
