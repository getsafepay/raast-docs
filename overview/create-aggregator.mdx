To access Safepay's Raast API, you must first be onboarded as an Aggregator. Aggregators are top-level accounts that manage merchants, issue access credentials, and initiate payments.

There is no self-serve option for creating Aggregator accounts. All requests must be manually approved by the Safepay team.

## How to Request an Aggregator Account

To begin:

1. Email support@getsafepay.com
2. Use the subject: Aggregator Access Request
3. Provide the following details in your message:
    - Legal Business Name
    - Business Website (if applicable)
    - Primary Contact Name & Email
    - Expected payment volume per month
    - Use case summary (who are your merchants, what type of payments you plan to enable)

Safepay will evaluate your request and respond with:

- A confirmation of account creation
- Your first API access key (see Request Access Key)
- A test environment if needed

Once onboarded, youâ€™ll have access to the full API suite to manage merchants and initiate transactions.
