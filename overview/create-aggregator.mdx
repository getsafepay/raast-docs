Start by requesting an aggregator account. Without it you cannot create merchants, payments, or payouts.

  <Step title="Prepare your request">
    Gather your legal business name, website, primary contact, expected monthly Raast volume, and a brief description of your use case.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Email Safepay">
    Send the details to [support@getsafepay.com](mailto:support@getsafepay.com) with the subject `Aggregator Access Request`.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Safepay review">
    Our team evaluates your application, performs preliminary compliance checks, and provisions an aggregator if approved.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Receive credentials">
    You receive your `{{aggregator_id}}`, an initial `{{secret_key}}`, and onboarding guidance for next steps.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Callout type="info">If you need multiple environments, mention Sandbox and Production in your initial request so Safepay can issue separate secret keys.</Callout>

### After approval

1. Store the provided secret key in your secret manager.
2. Follow [Manage aggregator secret keys](/overview/request-access-key) to rotate or create additional keys.
3. Create your first merchant using the [Quickstart](/overview/quickstart).
